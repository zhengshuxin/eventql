EventQL v0.4.0 beta;

  * Changed the parallel GROUP BY operation to use the new native protocol and
    to schedule all remote partial group bys from a a single thread using
    asynchronous I/O (currently via poll()).

  * Changed the evql client to use the new native protocol

  * Changed the connection acceptor code to read the first byte of an incoming
    connection and switch protocols (currently HTTP and native) based on this
    first byte

  * Changed the http server code to execute incoming requests from within a
    database thread (previously this was a generic thread pool)

  * Changed the internal cluster auth to require all internal hosts to be
    whitelisted using the cluster.allowed_hosts option. In standalone mode,
    the whitelist is defaulted to 0.0.0.0/0

  * Removed the obsolete "sha1_tokens" field from the cluster/server config

  * Removed the PCRE dependency

  * Added a native transport layer (a framed TCP-based protocol). See
    doc/internals/protocol.txt for the specification

  * Added a c client driver library (libevqlclient)

  * Added a thread-local storage and retrieval mechanism for the current
    session. This also adds a new requirement that all operations must be
    executed from within a valid database thread.

  * Added the following new configuration options: server.c2s_io_timeout,
    server.c2s_idle_timeout, server.s2s_io_timeout, server.s2s_idle_timeout,
    server.heartbeat_interval, cluster.allowed_hosts


EventQL v0.3.2 beta;

  * Fixed a bug in the eventql client (evql) where missing HOME and USER
    env variables would lead to an assertion on some libc++ implementations

  * Added --history_file and --history_maxlen flags to the eventql client (evql)


EventQL v0.3.1 (v0.3.1, git2da7f66) beta; 2016-09-04 16:11:19 +0000

  * Fixed a bug in the standalone backend where any ALTER TABLE statements
    would fail with "table already exists"

  * Changed the mapreduce reduce shard allocation so that (in most cases)
    repeated executions of the same job will result in (unchanged) reduce
    shards being scheduled on the same machines as before to improve cache
    hit rates.

  * Changed the default policy for handling failed mapreduce shards from ERROR
    (return an error to the user) to IGNORE (ignore the missing shard and
    continue without it)

  * Changed kDefaultMaxConcurrentTasks (the default maximum number of threads
    to be started for a single sql query) from 32 to 64

  * Added a new execution step to the mapreduce scheduler where, before running
    a given map task on any of the candidate servers, we try to retrieve it
    from cache on each of the candidate servers (and bail early if we find it).

  * Added verbose debug-logging to the MapReduce scheduler.

  * Added many documentation improvements, dockerfiles, examples, etc


EventQL v0.3.0 (v0.3.0-rc0, gita2fa235) beta; 2016-07-25 22:53:29 +0000

  * Renamed the project to EventQL (the previous name was ZenDB Z1)

  * Removed the old web interface and all non-core services such as the logfile
    service

  * Changed the sql query execution code to use and return result cursors (as
    opposed to non-interruptable result streams)
